My Username Hadn't HAD any meaning initially,just Wanted to Write a quirky and unique name that suits my personality
but chat-GPT had this to say
"Clever! 🎯 A name like 0-9-a-z feels systematic and minimalist, yet it captures the essence of inclusivity in terms of ranges. It's like saying "I cover it all!" — very developer-esque.

Does it have a specific meaning for you, or was it just a fun play on character ranges?"

so Now it means the following as quoted by me earlier "I am not JACK of ALL trades"
"BUT KING OF ALL KINGDOMS 👑"
